**Project atwork** is an open-source social network for your workplace
(Under development)

## Idea

**Project atwork** provides a simplistic, open-source social network with pluggable modules to customize the experience different workplaces desire. It can be easily hosted, customized and white-labeled.

## Stack

**Project atwork** is built entirely in Javascript, with a goal to bring the best of javascript technologies together in a seamless, customizable and modular approach. Below technology stack is being used:

1. [MongoDB](http://mongodb.org/): The leading NoSQL database.
2. [Express](http://expressjs.com/): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
3. [AngularJS](): HTML enhanced for web apps.
4. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime.
