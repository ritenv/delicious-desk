    abstract = {Low-tech, eye-gaze-accessible augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) options are important for individuals with motor impairments which result in limited voluntary movement, including many diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Available devices include EyeLink, partner-assisted scanning (PAS), and E-tran. The purpose of this study was to examine the rates of use for these devices, the user preferences related to them, and changes in rates and preferences over time. In another ongoing study component, Roman, Quach, Coggiola, and Moore (2010) investigated these devices with pairs of participants that included persons with ALS (PALS) and their communication partners. In this component, seven pairs of typical adults aged 45 or older participated. Over the course of five sessions with each pair, participants were taught to use and practiced use of these three devices. The quickest communication was accomplished through the use of EyeLink, but its rate of use did not differ significantly from that of E-tran. Use of PAS resulted in the slowest communication throughout the sessions. E-tran was the device most preferred by participants overall, and PAS was the least preferred. Through comparison of these results to those of the other study component, which included PALS as participants, the researchers hope to increase the generalizability of the study results and to better understand the ways a diagnosis of ALS may influence results.},

Specific tests of visual skills (for whole word or word-like patterns and for embedded symbol or symbol sequence) and of linguistic skills (for phonemic analysis and vocabulary knowledge) are recommended because they were shown to concurrent validity for achievement in word decoding and encoding for a disabled sample of beginning readers before and after a year of formal reading instruction; these tests can be administered in the same way to nonvocal, nonwriting individuals as to nondisabled individuals on whom the tests were normed. Tests are also recommended for monitoring text comprehension, once reading instruction is implemented that is adapted to the response capabilities of the nonvocal, nonwriting individual. Professionals in the field of augmentative and alternative communication are urged to advocate for the services of qualified reading specialists for severely communicatively handicapped individuals who are appropriate candidates for formal reading and spelling instructions.},

It is generally targeted for use by speech-impaired or non-speaking adults who have, however, intact language skills and at least rudimentary knowledge of grammar. This study was designed to develop a learning curve for Word Strategy, and to compare TouchTalker with traditional orthography. An additional goal was to determine if, as Light (3) has suggested, increasing the number of associations per icon also increases the number of confusions. Results indicated that after approximately 15 hours of training, sentence input speed for Words Strategy surpassed that of traditional orthography. Furthermore, the data did not support Light's contention. Results also indicated some recommended changes to both the software and the traditional Minspeak overlay.},

This effect is seen as a change in local gray or white matter density that correlates with behavioral measures. Critically, however, the cognitive and anatomical mechanisms underlying these learning-related structural brain changes remain unknown. Here, we combined brain imaging, detailed behavioral analyses, and white matter tractography in English-speaking monolingual adolescents to show that a critical linguistic prerequisite (namely, knowledge of vocabulary) is proportionately related to relative gray matter density in bilateral posterior supramarginal gyri. The effect was specific to the number of words learned, regardless of verbal fluency or other cognitive abilities. The identified region was found to have direct connections to other inferior parietal areas that separately process either the sounds of words or their meanings, suggesting that the posterior supramarginal gyrus plays a role in linking the basic components of vocabulary knowledge. Together, these analyses highlight the cognitive and anatomical mechanisms that mediate an essential language skill.},

However, the neural systems underlying adult rehabilitation of neurobiologically based learning disabilities remain unexplored, despite their high incidence. Here we characterize the differences in brain activity during a phonological manipulation task before and after a behavioral intervention in adults with developmental dyslexia. Phonologically targeted training resulted in performance improvements in tutored compared to nontutored dyslexics, and these gains were associated with signal increases in bilateral parietal and right perisylvian cortices. Our findings demonstrate that behavioral changes in tutored dyslexic adults are associated with (1) increased activity in those left-hemisphere regions engaged by normal readers and (2) compensatory activity in the right perisylvian cortex. Hence, behavioral plasticity in adult developmental dyslexia involves two distinct neural mechanisms, each of which has previously been observed either for remediation of developmental or acquired reading disorders.},

    abstract = {Purpose: This study examined the latency and accuracy measurements of five different augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) iPad apps evaluated in a previous study by Emmel (2013) and Graydon (2013). Latency can be defined as the amount of time necessary to complete a task, while accuracy can be defined as the correct number of correct button hits during the task. In their studies, Emmel (2013) and Graydon (2013) determined latency and accuracy of prescribed iPad apps through performance measures of typically developing adults who used the apps to complete functional communication tasks. The apps were selected following a systematic search of the iTunes Store and met pre-determined inclusion criteria. The current study sought to look at latency and accuracy more generally when studying Emmel (2013) and Graydon's (2013) findings. Further analysis sought to investigate the navigation sequence across the five different apps to determine if a difference exists between them that could explain the latency and accuracy data. 
Correlations between the latency measurements and accuracy scores were calculated using the Pearson r. Further analysis was then performed to assess the sequencing of each app by counting the number of button hits and page sets necessary to complete five chosen sentences. This analysis sought to provide support for the mean latency data produced in the studies by Emmel (2013) and Graydon (2013). Each sentence tested was chosen from a pool of 20 sentences used in Emmel (2013) and Graydon's (2013) study to generate phrase construction data. 
The results indicated overall correlations between latency and accuracy of +0.66 for spelling tasks and +0.98 for phrase construction tasks across all five apps. Therefore, the two areas of accuracy and latency are positively correlated. The study also found that support could not be given for the mean latency calculations collected by Emmel (2013) and Graydon (2013).This data cannot be explained through the positive correlation between latency and accuracy due to other factors not addressed in this study.  Future studies should explore the variations between specific apps such as page and display construction to determine if these factors influence the latency and accuracy of phrase construction.},

This presentation describes the journey Adwest has taken to becoming a centre of educational expertise for students Complex Communication Needs (CCN). 

We believe,  ” All students can learn,” and communication is the key to meaningful and engaging learning. Our 2012 Site Improvement Plan provided a vision of what, where and how our school was going to achieve this. 100\% of our schools population has Complex Communication Needs so it was evident that CCN should be a school focus. 

The presentation will show evidence of the intensive resourcing, funding and staffing commitment needed to build the schools knowledge and equipment base. 
Our thirst for knowledge and inquiring nature lead to investigations for appropriate devices, equipment and practices to ensure communication for students with CCN is embedded in our everyday practice. The complexities and individual needs of our students with physical disabilities means that accessibility solutions would be needed. Participants will gain a better understanding of the assistive technology options utilized and the vital support they play in developing our student's communication. 

Becoming a centre of educational expertise for students with CCN has lead AdWest on an exciting and challenging journey. We will share our professional development ideas and strategies for upskilling staff, who now have an extensive knowledge base. We now lead, coordinate and facilitate specialist learning and advice in CCN for education staff and agencies statewide.},

    abstract = {Aim
The aim of the project was to identify factors influencing implementation of AAC in the educational system for students with complex communication needs (CCN), concentrating on special schools in Germany and Hungary. In order to develop an implementation program, barriers to communication as well as enabling factors were determined. 


Method
The project was conducted in two steps. First, data was collected by interviewing 16 teachers and other professionals in Germany, and 12 in Hungary, applying the questionnaire and attitude scale known as PARCCA. Second, a sustainable program for implementing AAC in schools was developed using the results.

Results
1.In both countries, those interviewed mentioned both barriers and enabling factors to the implementation of AAC. 

2. Contrary to expectations, more enabling factors than barriers were mentioned. 

3.Most of the factors we identified arose from school practices.

4.The results of the interviews allowed us to identify factors to construct and implement a program facilitating the use of AAC in schools.


Conclusion
In Germany, the greatest challenge is improving networking among family, school and therapists. A more thorough knowledge of the subject and competence must also be developed among professionals. 
In Hungary, the greatest challenge is to educate teachers and other facilitators in using AAC.
AAC allows students with CCN to participate in social and academic activities, and both countries show a need for improvement in AAC, especially regarding school practices and professionals' competencies. To this aim, we have implemented our program.},

    abstract = {Background: Children with autism benefit from the use of visual supports to meaning, to support language growth. Visual supports are (a) graphic and symbolic stimuli that are used to aid communication and learning; and (b) effective in increasing the communication and language skills of children with autism. However, little is known of the views of parents, educators, and health professionals on the feasibility of implementing an immersive visual language program in a group setting providing early education to children with diverse developmental disabilities.

Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the views of key stakeholders on the feasibility of implementing a visual language program for children with diverse development disabilities in an early intervention setting. 

Method: Three one-hour focus groups were conducted separately with four parents, four educators, and five health professionals at an early intervention centre providing services to children with autism and other developmental disabilities in a group setting. Content analysis identified participants' views on barriers to and facilitators of implementing the visual language program. 

Results: Participants described using pictures for choice-making and visual schedules for children's orientation to time and place. Barriers to implementing visual supports in activities included lack of time, difficulties accessing visual supports quickly, lack of awareness of vidual supports, and lack of a consistent approach across settings. Facilitators included having access to assistive technologies including mobile technology, having time and being prepared to use visual supports, engaging as a team, aiming for consistency across settings, and increased awareness of the use and benefit of visual supports.

Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that implementing the full range of visual supports in early education settings for children with developmental disabilities is feasible. However, strategies to remove barriers and enable facilitators must be considered in the design of future research evaluating the effects of the program on children with autism.},

    abstract = {This article describes a computational model, called DIVA, that provides a quantitative framework for understanding the roles of various brain regions involved in speech acquisition and production. An overview of the DIVA model is first provided, along with descriptions of the computations performed in the different brain regions represented in the model. Particular focus is given to the model's speech sound map, which provides a link between the sensory representation of a speech sound and the motor program for that sound. Neurons in this map share with "mirror neurons" described in monkey ventral premotor cortex the key property of being active during both production and perception of specific motor actions. As the DIVA model is defined both computationally and anatomically, it is ideal for generating precise predictions concerning speech-related brain activation patterns observed during functional imaging experiments. The DIVA model thus provides a well-defined framework for guiding the interpretation of experimental results related to the putative human speech mirror system.},

@article{Brumberg2011Classification,
    abstract = {We conducted a neurophysiological study of attempted speech production in a paralyzed human volunteer using chronic microelectrode recordings. The volunteer suffers from locked-in syndrome leaving him in a state of near-total paralysis, though he maintains good cognition and sensation. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of supervised classification techniques for prediction of intended phoneme production in the absence of any overt movements including speech. Such classification or decoding ability has the potential to greatly improve the quality-of-life of many people who are otherwise unable to speak by providing a direct communicative link to the general community. We examined the performance of three classifiers on a multi-class discrimination problem in which the items were 38 American English phonemes including monophthong and diphthong vowels and consonants. The three classifiers differed in performance, but averaged between 16 and 21\% overall accuracy (chance-level is 1/38 or 2.6\%). Further, the distribution of phonemes classified statistically above chance was non-uniform though 20 of 38 phonemes were classified with statistical significance for all three classifiers. These preliminary results suggest supervised classification techniques are capable of performing large scale multi-class discrimination for attempted speech production and may provide the basis for future communication prostheses.},

@article{Buchsbaum2001Role,
    abstract = {Models of both speech perception and speech production typically postulate a processing level that involves some form of phonological processing. There is disagreement, however, on the question of whether there are separate phonological systems for speech input versus speech output. We review a range of neuroscientific data that indicate that input and output phonological systems partially overlap. An important anatomical site of overlap appears to be the left posterior superior temporal gyrus. We then present the results of a new event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment in which participants were asked to listen to and then (covertly) produce speech. In each participant, we found two regions in the left posterior superior temporal gyrus that responded both to the perception and production components of the task, suggesting that there is overlap in the neural systems that participate in phonological aspects of speech perception and speech production. The implications for neural models of verbal working memory are also discussed in connection with our findings.},

This circuit board, connected to a main control box with a lightweight cable, can be attached nearly anywhere on the body (i.e. the wrist). The gyroscope can sense when it is being rotated, and this information is read by an Arduino Mini microcontroller in the device's main control box. The user's wrist must be stable for an initial period before a ” Ready” LED lights up. Once the LED is lit, the user can either supinate or pronate her wrist. She then rotates her wrist back towards the initial resting position. If she turned her wrist far enough, a relay inside the control box will close. This relay can be used to trigger any switch-accessible device. It is possible for the user to adjust the length of the initial resting period, as well how far the user must rotate in order to trigger the relay. Limitations of the system are discussed, and future work is suggested.}},

Mobile technologies are being readily adopted by people with disabilities, including those with complex communication needs.” The accessibility of these mobile technologies, combined with the apparent growing acceptance of their appeal and low cost as communication tools—absent, it should be noted, evidence- based research that supports such assertions by way of data analyses and sound scientific review—has created a substantial and presumably growing market in the disability 'marketplace.' However, we still lack important information about (1) needed consumer education in choosing an APP, (2) Evidence-based research to support the use of these mobile technologies and the APPS, (3) public policy as it relates for funding, and (4) informed practice of professionals. This presentation will address each of these 4 important areas. In addition, in the absence of evidence-based research to guide practice, a consumer guide will be provided and discussed.}},

However, the small icon might make the pointing task more difficult on the small device. This study aimed to explore how the size of icon affects the performance of the pointing icons on the smart phone. Methods: Four children with intellectual disabilities were recruited to participate in a repeated measurement experiment. All the participated children were identified by the local education agent. Two factors design, operating method (one hand and two hands) and size of icon (3*5, 4*6, and 5*7), was adopted in this study. Accuracy and speed were used as indicators to represent the performance. Results: The results indicated that the accurate rates were higher when operating in two hands even in executing the tasks with smaller icons. However, the speed of pointing the target icon correctly was not significant difference between operating methods. One the other hand, generally, bigger icon gained higher accuracy and speed. Conclusion: The popular AAC app in typical handheld multi touch device usually adopt grilled layout design. Size of icons is one of the major considerations for designing layout. The results indicated that with the size decreased, the accuracy and speed decreased. Meanwhile two hands operating method could help the children with intellectual disabilities to perform higher accuracy.}},

@inproceedings{BakerLevelts,
    abstract = {{Exploring how to understand any AAC approach can be aided by insight into the word/language production experience of typical populations. Numerous models of language generation, both serial and constructionist, have been designed and promoted. Such theories typically divide processes into distinctive areas from conceptualization/semantic, lexical/syntactic, phonologic/phonetic, and onto motoric models necessary for articulation. There are various modern word-production models starting with Edward Sapir's Psychological Reality of the Phoneme (1933) to W.J.M. Levelt's serialist approach (1989), and the connectionist approaches described by Dell, Chang, \& Griffin (1999). All of these models understand language production as a word-by-word, function-by-function process with varying degrees of monitoring and feedback. From the field of AAC, itself, the first formal attempt at a model is Lloyd, Quist, \& Windsor (1989) based on Sanders' Aural Rehabilitation (1982). Environmental and gestural issues are present in all face-to-face communications though they are not treated in this paper beyond simple mention. The purpose of the presentation is to examine, speculate, and theorize about the internal linguistic elements of the experiential phenomena of two distinct populations -- typical speakers and augmented speakers. The process of traveling from the concept/preverbal message to the communicative act is discussed. The internal experiential dynamics of lexicon selection and syntax organization will be explored. From there, the authors will theorize further about the internal experiences of two groups of augmented communicators. Video interviews with augmented communicators are shown. The results of these inquiries should be a sharpening of researchers' questions about AAC users' language experiences.}},

Unique graphic materials in 20 languages and materials to support End of Life discussions will be shown. ICU specific layouts designed for the Grid 2 and also the Proloquo 2 Go app will be demonstrated. These layouts incorporate previous research (ICU Talk) by the Universtity of Dundee. Case studies will be used to demonstrate the value of patients being able to direct their care, report their symptoms, and direct their End of Life and treatment decisions in ICU. The impact of AAC for enhancing social closeness and ensuring a positive emotional legacy for communication partners will be highlighted. The discussion will also include the importance of enabling the human rights of the communication vulnerable population in acute care settings.}},

    abstract = {{Aim. Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology offers a potential communication access method for people with limited or unreliable motor function. As BCI technology matures and is implemented in the home for independent use, researchers should consider the principles of Participatory Action Research and user-centered design, incorporating the expertise, experiences, needs, and opinions of users and their family members and caregivers into design decisions and clinical practice. Patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) measures should be used to ensure that BCI meets the needs of users in the real world. The aim of our work is to solicit feedback from potential BCI users and their family members and paid caregivers, and to develop patient-centered outcomes measures for BCI. Method. Structured interviews were conducted with potential BCI users with severe speech and physical impairment (SSPI), as well as their family members and caregivers. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for common themes. Results. We present common themes related to participants' experiences with and opinions of their current communication methods, and their hopes and concerns about BCI as a communication access method. We discuss plans to design patient-centered outcomes measures for BCI-based communication systems. Conclusion. People with SSPI and their family members and paid caregivers can provide important insight into their needs and wants related to BCI-based communication systems, and their feedback should guide future BCI research and development. Patient-centered outcomes measures should be used to ensure that the needs of BCI users are being met by this technology when it is implemented in the home environment.}},

In the absence of reliable and valid research on Malay vocabulary for AAC, this descriptive study explored the validation process of vocabulary selection and organization for a 144-location manual communication board. An hour of aided language samples (talking while pointing to a prototype display) followed by self-administered surveys were gathered from four typical native Malay speakers (n=4), aged between 22 to 36 years at the University of Pittsburgh. Vocabulary frequency analysis, word commonality, and overall perceptions and feedback on the prototype display were compiled and analyzed. A total of 1112 word tokens and 450 word types were analyzed to support preliminary validation of the selected vocabulary and word organization of the prototype. Approximately 40\% of the words on the display were used during the interview and the top 20 words were reported. Findings also suggest the importance of morphology and syntax considerations at early design stages. The positive overall perception of the display including vocabulary selection, the cultural and ethnicity appropriateness, and suggestions for system improvement were confirmed by the usability survey. Minimal rearrangement of the icon display needs to be performed to improve the usability of the system. Thus, the study findings support the early Malay manual communication board for AAC intervention. However, the limitation of the sample size and limited exposure using the manual communication board needs an additional research is required to support a final display that optimizes vocabulary and morpho-syntactic organization.}},

This in turn could help to better understand how to organize symbols in speech-generating devices (SGD) and allow for a more efficient communication. Thirty undergraduate university students participated in this study. Students were presented with 120 trials where they were asked to locate a symbol within a grid of 16 symbols (4 by 4 interfaces). The symbol grids were created using Picture Communication Symbols (PCS) from the Boardmaker ® Plus! Program. Eye movements were captured using the EyeLink II system from SR Research Ltd. Company. Eye movements were analyzed using the EyeLink Data Viewer program (SR Research Ltd. Company). The analysis showed that the cells in the center of the grid were more successful in providing accurate selection, a faster reaction time, longer fixation rates, higher numbers of fixation and higher probability of being fixated. Whereas the 4th row (bottom) was less successful and obtained the opposite end of these results. The results of this study confirmed that the location and placement of a symbol is important for augmentative and alternative communication. Results of this study could help with the organization of symbols within an SGD and could allow for faster and more accurate communication by the user. For example, placing higher frequency symbols in the center of a grid and then placing lower frequency symbols or trained symbols in bottom row. Preliminary results observed in children will also be presented.}},

Intelligence and understanding are considered appropriate for his age, and thus his needs in the field of communication and language as well as curricular learning are very demanding and have required a progressive and laborious adaptation of symbol systems, forms of access and communication aids. To encourage aided language development very different communicative activities and homework assignments were designed both in natural contexts (family, day care and later the school) and in structured intervention situations in the Early Childhood Development and Intervention Center (CDIAP). This intervention process was carried out from a global habilitation approach in the areas of communication and language, adapted play, positioning and curriculum development. The intervention was carried out by an intense networking work between the different professionals of the centers involved, the Early Childhood Development and Intervention Center, the center that specifically supports AAC and technical aids, the daycare and subsecuent school, as well the family.

    abstract = {{Aim We wish to explore the use of electronic textiles for communication for individuals with severe disabilities through several related projects. The first will investigate a textile-based keyboard, combining the low cost and durability of low tech devices, with the added functions of more expensive technology. In the second, we focus on the problem of involuntary movement which often makes standard AAC devices unusable. We aim to detect functional intention amid hyperkinetic movement to inform existing access technologies. Methods A washable textile-based keyboard with a visual display, for use when more high-tech devices are impractical, has been tested in the lab for durability and usability. Additional features have been implemented, including layout customization and word prediction. For movement monitoring, we have first characterized potential sensor behavior for linear and single joint motion sensing. We will next extend these findings to the measure of full body motion, comparing results to standard movement monitoring technologies. Results Initial prototypes have been simple, fast and inexpensive to construct. Preliminary findings are promising, showing excellent results for durability and sensitivity of textile-based sensors in a variety of applications. Conclusion Although textile-based sensors in rehabilitation have traditionally been used in monitoring applications, they appear to have great potential in communication applications as well. Initial results warrant further research and technology development, with the goal of eventual testing of both technologies presented here with the target population.}},

    abstract = {{This presentation reviews narrative language samples produced over an 8-year period by a student who uses a sophisticated speech generating device as her primary means of verbal expression. Fifty samples were obtained, representing two narrative genres, personal and script narratives. Data on structure, cohesion, and linguistic richness will be presented. Narrative language is a form of discourse that is inherently different from other types of interaction. It is the language of storytelling, whether those stories are from personal experiences or events that one has seen, heard about, or imagined. Though the use of various genres of narrative language is greatly affected by culture, the ability to construct narratives is an important skill in most traditions and one that develops gradually. It emerges from our experiences in play and conversation, grows in complexity, and reaches toward abstraction throughout our preschool and primary school years. Stories play an important role in social interaction and influence the ways in which we think about ourselves and the world around us. Consideration of narrative language is particularly important for school-aged children given the strong role it plays in academic success and communicative competence. Narrative development may pose specific problems for students who use AAC given that skills in this area are built on a foundation of dialogue, conversation, and play. Most students with AAC needs do not have a rich history of extended discourse when they first enter school, and their access to imaginative play routines may have been limited. Many had restricted access to AAC options which allowed them to generate language. Others struggled with physical access and/or word retrieval, making conversation challenging and tiresome. For these reasons, difficulties with narrative development should be anticipated and addressed via a thorough evaluation. Information gleaned from that evaluation should then be used to plan intervention and guide classroom instruction and/or remediation. Narrative language is complex and requires a significant amount of generative language. Because students at the beginning stages of communication may have higher priorities for assessment, narrative language evaluation may be deferred until the student has an appropriate means of using language for conversation. Students with the ability to use language to converse (with or without support) will benefit from narrative language assessment and should participate in periodic evaluations of their narrative skills throughout the school years. Information regarding the construction of narratives is important for clinicians who serve children who use AAC. As a group, these students are known to have significant difficulties in this area (e.g., e.g., Grove \& Tucker, 2003; Soto \& Hartmann, 2006; Waller et al, 2001), but little is known about how their narrative skills develop over time. There are three main areas to consider in assessing narrative abilities: structure, cohesion, and linguistic richness (Paul, 2001). An examination of the narratives of four students who use AAC (Soto \& Hartmann, 2006), identified elements that were problematic for these children. They also identified story elements that were either absent or insufficient. These included some of the most common aspects of storytelling, the character and setting, as well as episode structure and evaluative remarks. Additionally, they noted significant difficulties with coherence. Their findings are consistent with narrative problems identified in children with language impairments. In this population, researchers noted deficits in grammar and syntax, and identified deficiencies in narrative production include fewer total and different words, diminished use of cohesive devices, and difficulties with story grammar (Swanson, Fey, Mills \& Hood, 2005). Narratives can be assessed through tools such as the TNL (Gillam \& Pearson, 2004) or using informal measures, such language sample analysis. This presentation discusses narrative samples analyzed using the Narrative Assessment Profile (NAP; Bliss, McCabe, \& Miranda, 1998; McCabe \& Bliss, 2003). The NAP focuses on topic maintenance, event sequencing, explicitness, referencing, conjunctive cohesion, and fluency. In addition, Soto and her colleagues recommend analysis of: •Total of number of clauses, •Clausal density, •Cohesiveness at the sentence level and with respect to the larger narrative (i.e., story coherence, use of story grammar elements, organization and structure) (Soto, Yu, \& Kelso, 2008) This session discusses personal and script narratives created by a student who uses AAC. They were obtained over an 8-year period in second through 10th grades. The student has dysarthria secondary to cerebral palsy and uses a high tech speech generating device as her primary means of verbal expression. Fifty samples were obtained, representing two narrative genres, personal and script narratives. Data on structure and linguistic richness will be presented. Information regarding narrative elicitation strategies will be shared.}},

    abstract = {{Children with severe speech and physical impairment (SSPI) often are significantly limited in their abilities to move, explore, interact, and play in the preschool environment. Along with accumulating evidence that motor development contributes to communication development and that delays in self-locomotion negatively affect future school performance, there is growing support that early intervention focusing on active exploration and problem solving promotes advancement of foundational skills across broad and lasting learning domains. To maximize participation and learning, every effort should be made to provide early movement and communication options that allow children with SSPI to do and experience what all children do and experience in preschool. We describe an intervention that is embedded within a carefully designed preschool program in which children with SSPI concurrently use hands-free support walkers and AAC systems during specified preschool activities. We introduce a range of considerations to guide selection and customization of hands-free support walkers to maximize function and allow children with SSPI to experience self-initiated upright mobility and gain access to activities, objects of interest, and interactions. We share video case examples demonstrating how various portable and stationary AAC tools are provided to support context-relevant communication as preschoolers move and play within the preschool environment. We discuss ways to monitor the impact of this approach on children's participation and progress across a range of learning foundations and desired outcomes. Children with the most severe levels of SSPI can experience movement, people, objects, and activities in ways that contribute to motivation, learning, achievement and fun!}},

    abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present current research on the use of visuals with individuals with autism, and to illustrate methods of expanding both speech and language development through unique visual strategies. Several visual tools and strategies will be presented in this paper, including: video modeling to promote speech development, color-coding to improve comprehension of wh-questions, and miscellaneous visual supports to improve social pragmatic skill development. Additionally, attendees will see video examples from the functional application of the tools described. Up to 50\% of the population of individuals with ASD have difficulty with language and communication and often fail to develop functional speech. Given the nature of the disability, those with ASD do not often benefit from traditional interactive spoken language environments. However, much evidence suggests that these individuals have relative strengths in visual processing. Specifically, research has demonstrated that (1) Persons with ASD tend to have relative strength in visual processing; (2) Persons with ASD often exhibit a preference for visual content and, (3) recent research indicates that they benefit from visually-based intervention strategies. Recent evidence suggests that capitalizing upon these interests, visual supports can be used to teach language and improve comprehension as well as expression in individuals with moderate to severe ASD (e.g., Shane \& Weiss-Kapp, 2007). Audience members will be challenged to think about visual supports in an expansive manner, far beyond simply requesting and protesting, and to use them with individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) to harness communication skills.}},

If possible, interviews will also be carried out with the children about their experiences using gaze controlled technology. The method Talking Mats® will then be used. Results At the conference, preliminary results from the questionnaires will be reported. Conclusion Gaze controlled systems is a relatively new technology. Assessment and implementation for children with multiple disabilities need specific competence, not yet acquired for all professionals working in the area of AAC and AT.

    abstract = {{This session will provide an in-depth look at occupational therapy's approach to the physical access assessment process for children with complex communication needs. The targeted goal of efficient, independent access to active participation in communication, computer use, academics, mobility \& leisure activities guides this approach. This multifaceted assessment process entails collection and synthesis of information relating to each child's unique sensory-motor abilities, vision, hearing, cognition, tone, seating and positioning. Goals for the child as well as environments in which they will be performed also need to be factored into the clinical decision making process. Once direct selection access options have been exhausted, switch access becomes the focus starting with control site identification, switch selection, switch placement and related accommodations resulting in ” functional switch use.” Using a switch for scanning access to communication devices requires considerable user demands and skills. Acquisition and mastery of these skills can be facilitated via a developmental progression of motivating switch activities in which the child builds confidence and success, prior to layering additional cognitive demands of language. Further focus on the progression of switch activities designed to develop motor patterns, success, and automaticity will follow. In-depth discussion of challenges of switch access to AAC devices will be discussed and highlighted through case studies with narrative and video.}},

Ninety-six participants (32 adults, 32 adolescents, and 32 children) were randomly assigned to one of two communication boards, application board and prediction board, controlling for age in each board. The experimental task consisted of thirty sentences and the participants were asked to select symbols to generate identically the target sentence presented on each screen board. In both rate and accuracy measures, significant differences were found among all age groups. This study suggests that the sentence prediction function of AAC device increases both speed and accuracy of sentence generation and it is more useful for children who use AAC. These findings support that the sentence prediction function should be provided at the early stages of AAC intervention}},

Five apps were selected following a systematic search of the iTunes Store and met inclusion criteria including capability to: synthesize speech, generate utterances using manufacturer-programmed individual whole words, pre-stored phrases, and spelling. Each participant completed ten experimental sessions. In each session, participants completed three functional communication tasks: navigating to a word, spelling a word, and constructing a phrase using manufacturer-programmed individual whole words. Each app was left in its manufacturer-programmed configuration and was not customized or altered. Minimal training was provided to the participants, consisting only of corrective feedback offered during the third session. In the current study, the correlations between the latency measurements and accuracy scores were calculated. The results indicated correlations of +0.66 for spelling tasks and +0.98 for phrase construction tasks. In conclusion, this study found that different apps have different levels of usefulness in word navigation, spelling and phrase construction, depending on the user preference.}},

The groups were matched for age and intellectual level. Both groups performed comparably on tests of phonologic awareness. The comparison group, however, scored higher than the disability group on the reading and writing tests, despite equal performance on phonologic tests. This difference between the groups fits with previous findings. On the other hand, it has been shown repeatedly among children without disabilities that phonologic awareness is highly predictive of literacy skills. This did not seem to hold for the nonspeaking children in this study. Explanations of the results were suggested including perceptual/cognitive limitations and limited interaction possibilities with the environment, resulting in limited acquaintance with print in a broad sense.},

Typically, young children's vocabulary items are organized on communication boards or computer displays according to what seems logical to speech-language pathologists, teachers, and parents. It remains unclear, however, whether adult-generated vocabulary arrangements truly reflect the cognitive organization of young children who require AAC. There are few empirical data to describe how young children organize vocabulary, particularly more abstract linguistic concepts. In the current study, a graphic symbol arrangement task was used to investigate how 20 children between 4;0 and 5;11 years of age organized linguistic concepts. The children were asked to organize 42 pictures depicting various familiar vocabulary items that included nouns, verbs, descriptors, prepositions, pronouns, and question words. During and after the sorting task, the children were asked to talk about the rationales for their arrangements. Results indicated that they purposefully arranged an average of 40\% of vocabulary items, and tended to organize concrete items (e.g., nouns, action verbs) in pairs or small groups according to event schema. The children had greater difficulty organizing abstract items (e.g., prepositions) than concrete words (e.g., cookie). Implications for AAC interventions are discussed along with future research directions.},

This review focuses on three issues important to researchers in this area: participant heterogeneity, assessment and instruction tasks, and research design. We found eight articles that reported attempts to teach phonological awareness and individual-word reading to a total of 26 children with SSI who used AAC. We evaluated these studies based on reporting of participant characteristics, assessment and instruction modifications, and the strength of research designs. We conclude by highlighting the need for standard assessments that can be used across studies, discussing strategies for facilitating meta-analyses, and suggesting the creation of an online database for researchers to share results on literacy instruction for this population.

    abstract = {
                This article discusses written language development in children with childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). Children with CAS are at risk for persistent reading and spelling disorder in addition to their spoken communication difficulties. The article highlights four factors that increase the risk of written language disorder in this population: (1) the nature of the speech disorder, (2) the presence of phonological awareness difficulties, (3) genetic risk factors, and (4) the negative impact of early reading difficulty on later written language development. The article suggests that traditional approaches used to target articulation in CAS may do little to develop skills that are critical to early literacy acquisition and stresses the importance of integrating speech, phonological awareness, and literacy goals for this population. Data presented from a pilot intervention study with three children with CAS aged 6 and 7 years highlight the potential benefit of an integrated phonological awareness approach to improve simultaneously speech, phonological awareness, and decoding ability. The need for further empirical evaluation of treatment approaches designed to improve the spoken and written language outcomes of children with CAS is emphasized.

                This article provides an overview of three important considerations when delivering evidence-based emergent literacy interventions: (1) treatment targets, (2) treatment techniques, and (3) treatment contexts. Treatment targets refer to the specific aspects of emergent literacy that clinicians address within their interventions and are organized into two broad areas: code-related skills and meaning-related skills. Specific targets within each skill area are identified. Treatment techniques refer to the specific clinical approaches used to address these targets. Using the scaffolding metaphor, we differentiate between use of high-support and low-support techniques for moving children along a continuum from dependence to independence. Treatment contexts refer to the location in which intervention is provided; prevalent contexts for provision of emergent literacy intervention include classroom-based, pull-out, and home-based (parent-implemented) interventions.

Caregivers of these children would change the way their children communicate by giving them normal speech, providing more services or by altering their children's AAC use. Thirty-two percent of caregivers reported their children used aided AAC. All of the aided AAC users reportedly used their systems at school and/or work, but less than 66\% used their systems at home. Caregivers of these children would change their children's systems by making them more sophisticated, portable, or unbreakable. A small percentage (5\%) of caregivers reported that their children used speech as their only mode of communication despite their severe speech impairments.},

After a 2-week immersion program and 1 year of follow-up training and supports, most of the 17 adults who responded to a questionnaire reported that learning to use a communication device had substantially helped them in many of the major life activities such as communication, maintaining a source of income, and acquiring new skills. The scope of communication was quite broad, including communicating with unfamiliar people, in a group; on the telephone; writing; giving formal presentations; and engaging in a wide range of advocacy. Based on this data, ?best practices? in augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) are described as well as major issues still facing people with significant physical and speech disabilities.},

The purpose of this study was to identify the needs, priorities, and preferences of mothers and fathers of older children for assistive devices and technology services. A total of 132 parents (i.e., 85 mothers and 47 fathers) representing 97 families responded to the survey. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Both mothers and fathers expressed priority needs for increasing knowledge of assistive devices and planning for future communication needs. Among the mothers' other priorities were needs for having social opportunities for the AAC adolescent with nonhandicapped peers, integrating assistive devices in the community, and having social opportunities for the AAC adolescent with other assistive device users. Fathers indicated needs for knowing how to maintain or repair an assistive device, integrating assistive devices at home, integrating assistive devices in educational settings, knowing how to program an assistive device, and getting computer access for their AAC adolescent. The importance of needs assessment is discussed and implications for family-based assessment and intervention practices in AAC are addressed.},

    abstract = {The present survey shows that in 1991?1992 there were 72 children, 37 adolescents, and 107 adults with cerebral palsy in Scotland who used some form of an augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) system. Among these, 61\% were males and 39\% were females. There has been a substantial increase in the use of AAC systems over the last 3 years and, indeed, over 50\% of users have had their AAC systems no longer than 1 year. The AAC systems identified in this study were broadly divided into low-technology and high-technology systems. Although the data show a tremendous increase in the use of high-technology systems, the low-technology systems still accounted for more than 50\% of all AAC systems used at present. There were a variety of methods of access both with low- and high-technology systems, indicating that a considerable proportion of users must rely on methods of access other than hand pointing. The majority of high-technology systems had voice output and all of the low-technology systems required listener interpretation (reading) of the message. It is important that, in addition to AAC systems, the users employed both their own idiosyncratic forms of nonverbal communication as well as other, more formalized, symbolic systems. Although the findings indicate that the great majority of users employed their AAC systems both in formal and informal situations, more investigations are necessary to establish why 22.2\% of users employed their AAC systems only in formal (i.e., therapy and school) contexts.},

@article{1996Augmentative,
    abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of sustainable augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) implementation within a developing country context. The dialogical model developed by Bergson is used to identify the two major components in intervention, that is, the intellectualized level of knowledge that refers to the logical application of AAC systems and the experiential level of attitudes and social structures within a community. Attempts at implementation of a dialogical AAC strategy are discussed by using a case study approach to training and implementation at the Centre for Augmentative and Alternative Communication at the University of Pretoria, South Africa. Some provisional conclusions on the implementation of a dialogically orientated AAC strategy are made that refer to appropriate technology and the redefinition of AAC strategies within a particular context. Finally, it is stressed that, as a human strategy, implementation should not be based on either intellectualization or intuition or experience but should be the result of synthesis in consciousness. Implementation based on intellectualization alone dehumanizes while implementation based on experience or intuition alone is haphazard and irresponsible.},

Information requested included timeliness of device acquisition, funding source, amount of training, frequency of use, and satisfaction with the device. Seventy-six questionnaires were returned and provided sufficient information for analysis. Demographic data were compiled and chisquare analyses were computed. Patients were grouped according to four medical diagnostic categories: cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke/neurologic diseases, and other disabilities. They ranged in age from 3 to 79 years. Results revealed 71\% of the respondents received devices. Third-party payers funded 81\% of these devices.

                A good understanding of the needs, desires, and capabilities of individuals with disabilities is critical if rehabilitation workers are to promote optimum quality of life. This survey was undertaken to determine the needs of a population of adults with disabilities as a result of neurological trauma or disease. We looked at communication, seating, mobility, environmental control, education, and leisure. Consideration of assistive technology's role in meeting these needs was achieved by an experienced Technology Access Team comprising a physiotherapist, occupational therapist, and speech pathologist in screening consenting residents. The initial needs survey identified that 37\% of clients in the study had problems with verbal communication, 62\% with cognition, and 52\% with seating. Assessments for electric wheelchairs were required by 21.5\% of clients while 30.7\% had problems with hand function for accessing. Further assessment for equipment and/or training was recommended in 123 (70\%) of the 163 participants. These findings have implications for management, including raising awareness of technology's benefits. There are also implications regarding staff knowledge and specialist skills required to identify needs and technological solutions. Preliminary recommendations await validation as individual's requirements are further investigated.

    abstract = {There can be little doubt that effective communication is of crucial relevance to the quality of life of individuals with learning disabilities. What is much less certain is how 'effective communication' is defined, still less how it can be maximised. However, there has been considerable progress towards understanding the dual nature of communication difficulty; the intrinsic nature of an individual's communication and the extrinsic factors which influence communication experience in profound ways. This paper will discuss the development of communication skills in this context, outlining the essential components of a strategy for communication development. It will highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to addressing the communication needs of adults with learning disabilities. It will stress the need for agreed standards and procedures, careful co-ordination between health and social service agencies, and on-going monitoring of service provision. Too often, too little has been provided on an ad hoc basis, with little concern for an overall strategy. Progressive services incorporate an agreed strategy on how to build communication skills for all services users, in the same way that strategies on housing or employment might be formulated. Communication development can only succeed on this basis.},

@article{Jenkinson1993Who,
    abstract = {ABSTRACT In the context of normalisation and rights recognition, capacity for decision-making by people with an intellectual disability has emerged as an important but potentially contentious issue. Although increased community integration has opened up many new options, opportunities for greater autonomy are still unnecessarily constrained. Perceptions of limited competence, the issue of who has control over choices, and organisational structures are some of the factors which influence the extent to which clients are able to make decisions. This paper argues that, in order to resolve these issues, decision-making by people with an intellectual disability should be studied within the broader context of psychological theories of decision-making and human behaviour. Theoretical findings are reviewed and areas identified in which decision-making behaviour may break down. The relevance of theoretical research to issues of competence and empowerment, and to the small body of research on decision-making and choice by people with an intellectual disability is discussed. It is concluded that future research should focus on contextual variables, including the nature of the decision to be made, which affect decision-making competence in people with an intellectual disability.},

@article{1994Application,
    abstract = {Recently, the use of a model of normal language acquisition has been questioned in terms of its application to the study of language acquisition in children with little or no functional speech. These children, particularly those with severe motoric challenges, may exhibit atypical patterns in their language development. The need to examine other developmental theories sensitive to these potential unique patterns is warranted, and the purpose of this study was to conduct such an investigation. Specifically, Vygotsky's concept of the ?Zone of Proximal Development? (ZPD) was used in conjunction with a normal model to develop methodology appropriate to the longitudinal study of language acquisition in a young child with cerebral palsy. Over a 10-month period, the child was engaged in collaborative interaction with an adult partner providing structured guidance (i.e., prompts) to elicit certain prelinguistic communicative functions. Overall, findings indicated an increase in the frequency of the child's communicative function initiations with the adult partner across time. These results were interpreted as evidence for the child's progression through the ZPD.},

                Analysis of the abnormalities present in autistic patients, using standard methods of clinical inference, leads to the conclusion that the manifestations of childhood autism correlate best with the manifestations of dysfunction in the frontal tier of the ring of phylogenetically older cortex located on the mesial surface of the frontal and temporal lobes ("mesocortex" or "mesolimbic cortex") and with the manifestations of dysfunction in the striatum. These structures are distinctive in ways that suggest possible etiologies. The observations and inferences that lead to these conclusions are outlined and are supplemented by data from recent studies by the authors. Emphasis is placed on disorders of motility, communication, and attention and perception.

@article{Johnson1989Hellish,
    abstract = {Abstract This papers deals with a remarkable phenomenon which has occurred in a residential home for 14 severely mentally and physically handicapped young adults in Copenhagen, Denmark. None of the residents has speech, and all had been evaluated as severely mentally handicapped. It has been estimated that these people would never develop mentally beyond a functioning level of 1/2-3 years. Between 1984 and 1985 it was discovered that two female residents could spell out words by pointing to letters on a board. Over a period of 9 months in 1986 we discovered, through the prompting of these two residents who insisted that some of the other residents could also write and through the persistent curiosity of some members of staff, that all of the other 12 residents could also write. This paper relates something of how the discovery came about, of the reactions of people in the immediate circle of contacts, of the enormous change in daily life in the house that has occurred as a result of this discovery, and attempts to point to how this phenomenon might have been caused.},

                Among 236 in-patients in one hospital for the mentally handicapped, there was a significant relationship between the amount of motor disorder (rated using a comprehensive check-list) and the severity of mental handicap, the presence of associated psychiatric disorder and the use of neuroleptic medication. The population was fairly evenly divided between those currently, previously and never having received neuroleptic medication. All categories of motor disorder, including abnormal movements, were present in all three subgroups. Neuroleptic medication appeared to modify the expression of motor disorder rather than producing it de novo. The range and frequency of motor disorders was comparable with that in patients with severe psychiatric illness. A common cerebral basis for the motor disorders of patients with mental handicap and severe psychiatric illness is suggested.

Fourteen subjects transcribed text with and without a word prediction feature for seven test sessions. Eight subjects were able-bodied and used mouthstick typing, while six subjects bad high-level spinal cord injuries and used their usual method of keyboard access. Use of word prediction decreased text generation rate for the spinal cord injured subjects and only modestly enhanced it for the able-bodied subjects. This suggests that the cognitive cost of using word prediction had a major impact on the performance of these subjects. Performance was analyzed in more detail by deriving subjects' times for keypress and list search actions during word prediction use. All subjects had slower keypress times during word prediction use as compared to letters-only typing, and spinal cord injured subjects had much slower list search times than able-bodied subjects. These parameter values were used in a two-parameter model to simulate subjects' word entry times during word prediction use, with an average model error of 16\%. These simulation results are an encouraging first step toward demonstrating the ability of analytical models to represent user performance with word prediction},

                This study examines how the cognitive and perceptual loads introduced by a word prediction feature impact learning and performance. Two groups of able-bodied subjects transcribed text using two row-column scanning systems for 10 consecutive trials each. The two systems differed only in that one system had a word prediction feature. Subject groups differed in their order of system use. The results show that, under the conditions of this study, the word prediction system was not substantially more difficult to learn, but it did not yield a statistically significant improvement in text generation rate. This suggests that the cost of using this word prediction system balanced the benefit of the keystroke savings achieved by these subjects. The relationship between keystroke savings, cost in item selection rate, and improvement in text generation rate is explored in order to provide insight into this outcome.

                A longitudinal study of augmentative communication training with 40 language-impaired, cerebral palsied children examined the acquisition of Blissymbols and Makaton Vocabulary signs and syntactic aspects of their use over an 18-month period. The children made measurable gains in these areas over time, but progress was very slow and they continued to show severe limitations in the repertoires of signs/symbols they acquired and in the average number, length and complexity of utterances they produced in semi-structured conversational settings. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed with reference to subject and system characteristics, and the teaching practices adopted in the schools. Comparisons between the Bliss and signing groups suggest that neither augmentative system facilitated greater progress in sign/symbol acquisition and use than the other. However, there was wide variability in performance among the children within each group.

They are necessary to facilitate the memorization and subsequent recall of information, including preprogrammed vocabulary (i.e., single words and longer texts) and codes that retrieve vocabulary programmed under several keys (e.g., in Minspeak?-based applications). The augmentative and alternative communication field could benefit from existing research that has examined the development of memory strategy use in young children. Memory strategies differ in terms of their functional properties, such as automaticity, reliance on symbolic mediators, and overall complexity. Developmental constraints are reflected in predictable performance errors. Adults can help children become insightful about when, how, and why to apply a memory strategy. This insight, called metamemory, can motivate a child to complete boring tasks (e.g., memorizing codes).},

    abstract = {This paper proposes a definition of communicative competence for individuals using augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems. The proposed definition suggests that communicative competence is a relative and dynamic, interpersonal construct based on functionality of communication, adequacy of communication, and sufficiency of knowledge, judgement, and skill in four interrelated areas: linguistic competence, operational competence, social competence, and strategic competence. Linguistic and operational competencies refer to knowledge and skills in the use of the tools of communication; social and strategic competencies reflect functional knowledge and judgement in interaction. The paper urges future research to validate the proposed definition of communicative competence and suggests some implications for assessment and intervention in the AAC field.},

    abstract = {This study examines the performance of AAC users on a formal measure of social-verbal competence. The Let's Talk lnventory for Adolescents(Wiig, 1982, Columbus, OH, Charles E. Merrill) was administered to four individuals who communicate via Blissymbolics. Forty speech acts, representing the communicative functions of Ritualizing, Informing, Controlling, and Feeling, were elicited in each of two registers (Peer and Authority). The data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively using the following procedures: (a) a comparison of overall and subscores in each communicative function and register with those presented in the test manual for normally developing 7 to 14 year olds; (b) analysis of correct responses in terms of syntactic structure, attenuation (the softening of the speech act), and amplification, and descriptive comparison of the subjects' use of these features with that of normally developing 7 to 14 year olds; (c) analysis of speech acts which were passed by all subjects in both contexts and those which were passed by fewer than two subjects in each context; (d) analysis of errors re: available vocabulary and understanding of the situation. The results showed variation in the subjects' ability to fulfill speech acts in the four communicative functions. As a group, the subjects were most successful in the Informing function, followed by Ritualizing, Controlling, and Feeling. Although the Blissymbol users produced many of the same syntactic structures and attenuation devices as were found among the normal groups, differences related to the nonspeech mode were evident. An elicited speech act format is felt to be a valuable addition to the body of measures for evaluating the communication abilities of nonspeaking individuals.},

                This study examined the effects of using messages with conversational rule violations on attitudes toward people who used utterance-based augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems in transactional interactions. Specifically, the ratings were compared across messages with relevance, informativeness, and brevity violations, when latency remained constant (i.e., short). The 96 participating sales clerks viewed scripted, videotaped bookstore conversations and completed an attitude questionnaire. Results indicated that the prestored message with repeated words/phrases was rated the highest, followed by the message with excessive information; next was the message with inadequate information, followed by the message with partly relevant information. The findings may be useful to those using utterance-based systems when making message choices during interactions with service providers. Technological implications point to the development of schema/script-based systems and intelligent editing.

@article{2003Common,
    abstract = {Children and adults with developmental delays have benefited from the use of augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems to develop language skills necessary for more generative and functional communication. Beginning communicators however, have historically been considered too young or too pre-linguistic and therefore have not been introduced to AAC systems until behaviors, thought to be prerequisites, have been noted. Recent research and theories about early communication development have challenged this traditional practice and broadened the scope of what is considered to be AAC. Practitioners and parents unfamiliar with early AAC options may not recognize possible applications of communication strategies used with typically developing children and older persons with developmental disabilities. AAC is applicable at all ages for learning communication roles and behaviors as well as for functional communication for persons who do not yet demonstrate clear referential symbol use. This article addresses nine questions that are frequently asked about early introduction of AAC systems to children under 3 years of age. Rationales and strategies are provided that can assist early interventionists and parents in considering AAC options for children at risk for being unintelligible or non-speaking.},

Five major themes emerged from the discussion: (a) selection of an AAC device; (b) knowledge and skills needed to use AAC technologies; (c) instruction and practice activities; (d) assessment of skill acquisition; and (e) advice to others. Participants reported that a consumer-driven assessment approach, which included the opportunity to discuss options with other individuals who used AAC, was key to the selection of an appropriate device. Participants identified a wide variety of important supports to learning how to make effective use of AAC technologies, including text and technological supports, individual exploration, learning from professionals, drill and practice, learning from peers, and opportunities for functional use in the community. For the participants, successful use of AAC technology was best assessed by functional use in the community.},

@article{Bishop1989Unimpaired,
    abstract = {In normal adults, concurrent articulation impairs short-term memory, abolishing both the phonological similarity effect and the word length effect when visual presentation is used. It also interferes with ability to judge whether visually presented words rhyme. It is generally assumed that concurrent articulation impairs performance because it prevents people from recoding material into an articulatory form. If this is the explanation, then individuals who are congenitally speechless (anarthric) or speech-impaired (dysarthric) should show the same impairments as normal individuals who are concurrently articulating?i.e. they should have reduced memory spans, fail to show word length and phonological similarity effects in short-term memory, and find rhyme judgement difficult. These predictions were tested in a study of 48 cerebral palsied individuals: 12 anarthric, 12 dysarthric, and 24 controls individually matched to the speech-impaired subjects. There was no impairment of memory span in speech-impaired subjects, who showed normal phonological similarity and word-length effects in short-term memory. Speech-impaired subjects did not differ from their controls in ability to tell whether names of pairs of pictures rhymed. These results challenge the notion that ?articulatory coding? is implicated in short-term memory and rhyme judgement and suggests that processes such as rehearsal and phonemic segmentation involve generation of a more abstract central phonological code.},

    abstract = {
                This study investigated the link between expressive phonological impairments, phonological awareness, and literacy. Previous investigations of literacy skills in children with speech impairments have given mixed results; here we considered whether presence of additional language impairments or severity of the speech impairment was an important prognostic factor. Thirty-one children with expressive phonological impairments were compared with control children matched on age and nonverbal ability on three occasions, at mean ages of 70, 79, and 91 months. On each occasion they were given three tests of phonological awareness: one involved rime-matching and two involved onset-matching. At assessments 2 and 3 literacy skills were assessed. Children with phonological impairments scored well below their controls on phonological awareness and literacy, independent of whether or not they had other language problems. Although many of them knew letter sounds, they were poor at reading and writing nonwords as well as real words. It is suggested that both the speech impairment and the literacy problems arise from a failure to analyze syllables into smaller phonological units. The severity of the phonological problems in relation to age is an important determinant of literacy outcome; children who have severe expressive phonological impairments at the time they start school are at particular risk for reading and spelling problems.

Thirty-two participants with cerebral palsy and no intelligible speech who used augmentative and alternative communication (AAC user group) and 32 students with impaired but intelligible speech (speech-impaired group), aged 7.5 to 17.5, as well as reading-level-matched controls (younger children with normal speech and no physical disabilities) were assessed on a protocol of phonological processing in three areas: retrieval of whole-word phonology, phoneme awareness, and phonological recoding. Phoneme awareness and phonological recoding were assessed from beginning to advanced levels. Reading assessment included two nonspeech measures of word reading. Between-group comparisons indicated that, compared to reading-level-matched controls, both the AAC user and the speech-impaired group scored significantly lower in all areas of phonological processing. Relative strengths and weaknesses in phonological processing were identified. For example, although AAC users and students with impaired but intelligible speech showed relatively good competence in using sound-letter correspondences to recognize unknown printed strings, they showed low skill in using sound-letter correspondences to spell, even though in speaking children these two skills are comparable. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for understanding and addressing the literacy learning needs of students with congenital motor speech impairments.},

The children were videotaped during two 10-minute story reading sessions with their mothers; the interactions were transcribed and coded. Results indicated that the participation patterns were asymmetrical. The mothers dominated the exchanges, and the children forfeited many of their communicative opportunities. The interactions were synchronous; the dyads shared a focus in the interactions. There was some variation across the dyads with respect to the specific communicative interaction patterns observed. The children in Dyads 3 and 4 participated infrequently during the story reading sessions; the children in Dyads 1, 2, and 5 were more active in the story reading interactions and demonstrated a greater range of communicative behaviors. Directions for intervention and for future research are discussed in light of the results.},

Specifically, the effect of instruction on the selection of initial letters of words by 3 children with developmental disabilities who used AAC was evaluated. The writing instructional program comprised direct instruction in letter-sound correspondence and selection of initial letters of words, and a writing workshop-type task to provide instruction in literacy activities. Two of the 3 children were successful in the acquisition of the target skill, maintained use of the skill at least 1 month following instruction, and demonstrated some generalization of the skill to less structured tasks. The third child required a simplified instructional program to accommodate transient episodes of hemiplegia and to increase his time on task. The results of the study suggest that an instructional program that combines a direct instruction approach and a writing workshop-type activity may facilitate the development and application of phonemic awareness skills with children who use AAC.},

The study was designed to examine the use of microswitch manipulanda to facilitate the awareness of social contingencies as a potential foundation for the development of intentional communicative behavior.

METHOD: A single-subject withdrawal design with multiple phases, including one alternating treatments phase, was used to investigate the participant's ability to perform selective, voluntary motions as indicators of contingency awareness and preferences. Social validity also was assessed. RESULTS: The child demonstrated the ability to use two switch sites to activate adapted switch-operated devices when a preferred stimulus was contingent on a specific motor action, and she demonstrated the ability to communicate preferences as indicated by more frequent switch activations for one consequence than for a second consequence. Social validity results indicated that both the parents and school personnel generally viewed the evaluation/intervention process as positive. CONCLUSIONS: Single-subject research methods, combined with social validation procedures, can be used effectively in the evaluation/intervention process for children with profound multiple disabilities.},

                The Individuals with Disabilities Act was implemented in 1975 to assure that all children aged 0-21 years old have access and the right to an equal education. However, young children with disabilities continue to need additional support to meet the reading readiness standards as outlined in The No Child Left Behind legislation (2004). Although all children benefit from readiness skills, it is essential for children with special needs. With the technology boom of the past decade, assistive technology (AT) has been used increasingly to enhance emerging literacy skills. In order to identify current trends in the use of AT as a means to enhance emergent literacy skills in young children with disabilities, a systematic review of the literature was undertaken. The findings from this review support the scarcity of empirical research demonstrating the benefit of AT to promote emergent literacy with young children with disabilities. We also found a need for evidence supporting education approaches for the proper use of AT in early childhood literacy as well as little family knowledge regarding the implementation and instructional use of AT.

    abstract = {
                School-age students who use AAC need access to communication, reading, and writing tools that can support them to actively engage in literacy learning. They also require access to core literacy learning opportunities across grade levels that foster development of conventional literacy skills. The importance of the acquisition of conventional literacy skills for students who use AAC cannot be overemphasized. And yet, one of the critical challenges in supporting the literacy learning of students who use AAC has been a lack of knowledge about literacy curricula and supports to literacy learning for these students. Most students who use AAC do not become conventionally literate and few of those who do achieve literacy skills beyond the second grade level. This article will provide an overview of the most frequent reading instructional activities in first and third grade classrooms. To better understand the foundational experiences important to literacy learning, the results of a survey project that examined the reading activities of general education students and teachers during primary grade instruction are presented, and critical shifts in instruction that occurred between first and third grade are highlighted. The primary instructional focus of core reading activities is also examined, along with adaptations for students who use AAC.

Questionnaires were completed by 15 parents of children in each group. Results of the survey indicated that the general reading and writing environments in the households of the two groups were similar: there were available a range of literacy materials and regular models of others reading and writing. Although both groups of children were reported to be interested in literacy activities, the children in the AAC group had less opportunity to use printed materials or to participate in writing/drawing activities. When engaged in story reading activities, the children in the AAC group seemed to be less involved in initiating and asking questions about the text than the children in the ND group. Parental priorities for their children differed somewhat between the two groups. The parents in the AAC group gave highest priority to communication and then to physical needs such as mobility and feeding. The parents of the ND group gave highest priority to communication and making friends, and then to literacy activities. Results of the study are discussed in light of the literature, and directions for future research are suggested.},

@article{1997Facilitating,
    abstract = {Several major transitions in language use take place during the first 5 years of life. Each transition allows the child to move to a higher level of complexity of expression and to accomplish communicative goals more flexibly and precisely than was done at the previous level. At least three of these transitions appear to be modulated to some degree by speech. In the first transition, prelinguistic to early linguistic communication, babbling provides the infant with a prelinguistic form of vocal behavior that is in many ways analogous to language. A second transition takes place in the movement from single words to multiword combinations. In the process of this transition, word order becomes a means by which children convey semantic role information, and transitional forms such as successive one-word utterances help to facilitate the child's leap from single-word speech to multiword sentences. A third transition involves the development of phonological awareness, an important basis for the acquisition of literacy, which builds on the foundation laid by the phonological system for articulation. In each of these transitions, speech appears important for mediating the move to a higher language level. This paper considers the question of how these transitions can be facilitated in children who use augmentative and alternative communication rather than speech as a first expressive system, in order to provide as precise and flexible a communication modality as possible to children with severe speech impairments.},

                The aim of the study was to investigate the effectiveness of three feedback conditions, using a speech-generating device, on spelling performance of Tom, an 11-year-old boy with cerebral palsy and complex communication needs.
                Tom was taught to spell 12 words under three feedback conditions. In the SPEECH condition, he received only speech feedback from the device and in the PRINT condition he received only the orthographic feedback on the display of the device. In the SPEECH-PRINT condition, Tom received both speech output and orthographic feedback. An adapted alternating treatment design was used to investigate the effects of the three-feedback conditions. To strengthen the reliability and increase the internal validity of the findings, an intrasubject direct replication was carried out using the same procedure, but teaching 12 different spelling words to Tom.
                Tom reached criterion with the PRINT feedback condition first, followed by SPEECH and SPEECH-PRINT conditions simultaneously for the first 12 words, and the same order for the second set of 12 words.
                Overall, the PRINT condition was most efficient for Tom. The results are discussed in terms of evidence for learning style preferences within spelling instruction for a child with complex communication needs. Furthermore, the implications for targeting intervention to optimise spelling achievement amongst this group are considered.

A sample of 14 alternative keyboards and pointing devices commonly used by people with disabilities were appraised by 35 disabled adults. A multi-disciplinary panel of independent assessors also appraised the products. We identified key factors regarding the set-up, personal acceptability, ease of use, design features, compatibility and potential limitations of each device. We found that difficulties in accessing computers could sometimes be reduced or overcome by adjusting the existing workstation and customizing computer settings rather than through additional technology. However, successful computer access often requires a combined approach, as a single piece of equipment will rarely provide a complete solution. If alternative computer input devices are necessary, it is likely that the hardware settings will need customizing.},

Results demonstrated that some children as young as 6 months of age could control a computer-based, cause-and-effect program using a single-switch access system. Therefore, professionals who work with children with disabilities may consider introducing computers to children at this age or to children who are functioning near this cognitive developmental level.}},

                The purpose of this study was to compare two conditions for teaching two children with autism (ages 4;10 and 5;4) who used Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) to point to the printed letter that corresponded to the spoken letter sounds of /t/ and /m/. In one condition (gradual array), the printed letter was first presented in isolation and then distracter letters were gradually introduced. In the other condition (fixed array), the printed letter was immediately presented in combination with seven distracter letters. Using an alternating treatment design, results revealed that the fixed array condition resulted in a faster rate of acquisition of target skills for both participants. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

    abstract = {
                Children with severe and multiple disabilities constitute a heterogeneous population that typically experiences significant and lifelong difficulties in learning to read and write. These difficulties appear to be both intrinsic and environmental in nature. Children with severe and multiple disabilities struggle particularly with vocabulary acquisition and phonological awareness. Home, preschool, and school environments may limit literacy learning opportunities by making literacy a lower priority than the child's competing health, self-care, and therapeutic needs; by providing limited access to adapted print materials or tools; by providing limited access to communication supports; or by providing little time for literacy learning. Children with severe and multiple disabilities who have demonstrated literacy learning progress are often taught in technology-supported environments offering a wide range of word study, text-based reading and writing instruction, and opportunities for print exploration. Sufficient evidence exists for clinicians and educators to begin providing more successful literacy instruction to individual children and classrooms by comparing their children and intervention contexts with those reported in the limited body of research in this area.

                The purpose of this article is to summarize the literacy outcomes for children with specific language impairment and to consider principles and approaches for literacy intervention with preschool and early school-age children with language impairments. Initially, specific language impairment is defined and differentiated from nonspecific language impairment. In addressing intervention considerations, we first consider the application of best practice principles and then specifically focus on intervention with preschool children and intervention with early school-age children. Consideration of evidence-based treatment approaches is guided by the developmental literature and by the intervention literature.

@article{2006Phonological,
    abstract = {To investigate the importance of the connection between being able to speak and the emergence of phonological awareness abilities, the performance of children with cerebral palsy (five speakers and six non-speakers) was assessed at syllable, onset-rime, and phoneme levels. The children were matched with control groups of children for non-verbal intelligence. No group differences were found for the identification of syllables, reading non-words, or judging spoken rhyme. The children with cerebral palsy who could speak, however, performed better than the children with cerebral palsy who could not speak and the control group of children without disabilities, judging written words for rhyme. The children with cerebral palsy who could not speak performed poorly in comparison to those who could speak (but not the control group of children) when segmenting syllables and on the phoneme manipulation task. The findings suggest that non-speaking children with cerebral palsy have phonological awareness performance that varies according to the mental processing demands of the task. The ability to speak facilitates performance when phonological awareness tasks (written rhyme judgment, syllable segmentation, and phoneme manipulation) require the use of an articulatory loop.},

@article{DahlgrenSandberg2006Reading,
    abstract = {
                Development of literacy skills was studied in six children (one male, five females) with severe speech impairments and cerebral palsy (CP). These skills were related to intellectual development, phonological abilities, and short-term memory. Three of the children were diagnosed with dystonia, and three with diplegia. They had no, or severely restricted, independent mobility (Gross Motor Function Classification System Level IV for four children and Level V for two), and severe fine motor problems, including difficulty with pointing. As they had no intelligible speech, the Bliss system was the primary communication mode. Assessments were made at approximately 6, 9, and 12 years of age. The results revealed that the children had difficulties acquiring literacy skills, although intellectual level and phonological ability predicted otherwise. Positive development during the first 3 years was followed by an arrest. A conspicuous decrease in IQ points was also found. Thus, phonological ability does not seem to have the same predictive power for literacy development in children with severe speech impairments and CP as in typically developing children. Further studies are needed to clarify the role of phonological abilities, working memory, and strategies used in literacy acquisition in these children. Such studies might also clarify the importance of articulatory abilities in early literacy acquisition.

Strategies based on the National Reading Panel's research-based findings for effective reading instruction are used as guidelines for adapting instruction to incorporate users of AAC. Techniques for teaching phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary development, and text comprehension are provided. Because of the emphasis placed on oral reading in developing fluency, this skill area is not directly addressed. Rather, this article provides strategies for developing a skill more directly relevant to AAC users— multimodal meaning making.

Forty-two elementary students with LD were randomly assigned to one of two instructional groups to teach spelling words: (a) a rule-based strategy group that focused on teaching students spelling rules (based on the "Spelling Mastery Level D" program) and (b) a traditional instruction group that provided an array of spelling activities (i.e., introducing the words in the context of story, defining the meaning of the words, sentence writing, and dictionary skill training) to teach spelling words. Daily instructional sessions lasting 30 minutes were conducted for 4 consecutive weeks. Four different word types (i.e., regular, morphological, spelling rule, and irregular) were introduced as instruction progressed. After receiving instruction in one of the instructional groups, the students were compared on scores from unit tests, a standardized test, a sentence-writing test, a transfer test, and a maintenance test. Overall results indicated that the rule-based strategy group using "Spelling Mastery Level D" was more effective in increasing student-spelling performance, particularly for the regular, morphological, and spelling-rule words. The instructional implications of these findings are discussed. (Contains 7 tables.)}},

However, while stressing the potential of genetics and neuroscience for guiding assessment and educational practice at some stage in the future, we argue that there is a mistaken belief that current knowledge in these fields is sufficient to justify a category of dyslexia as a subset of those who encounter reading difficulties.

Overall, we investigated if very young children who are in the early stages of language acquisition can learn vocabulary quickly (fast map) from television programs. Using a fast mapping paradigm, this study examined a group (n = 48) of toddlers (15?24 months) and their ability to learn novel words. Utilizing a repeated measures design, we compared children's ability to learn various novel words in 5 different conditions. These included the presentation and identification of a novel word by an adult speaker via live presentation when the toddler was attending (i.e., joint reference), an adult via live presentation when the toddler was not attending, an adult speaker on television, and an edited clip from a children's television program (Teletubbies). Overall, the toddlers were most successful in learning novel words in the joint reference condition. They were significantly less successful in the children's program condition. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between age and condition on children's performance. Both younger (15?21 months) and older (22?24 months) participants identified the target objects when they were taught the novel word by an adult speaker; however, it appeared that children under the age of 22 months did not identify the target item when they were taught the novel word via the television program.}},

Ogden's (1930) attempt to formulate an 850-word lexicon that would have as wide a communicative range as possible using a minimum number of words of general meaning, is a famous one (for a description and comments, see also Carter and McCarthy 1988: 2-6). West's (1953) General Service List is still considered by many to be unsurpassed in its usefulness, and other word lists that distinguish between core or elementary level words and more advanced words (e.g. Hindmarsh 1980), and cut-down or 'essential' versions of larger dictionaries for language learners have kept the quest alive. On the theoretical level, Carter (1987) has discussed the 'core' properties of certain words and suggested criteria for any word to qualify as a core word. And for many decades, pedagogical linguists have attempted to grade vocabulary for the purposes of syllabus design, creating word-lists as targets for different levels of accomplishment or for testing purposes, and presenting beginners' or elementary vocabulary in teaching materials, often simply based on a powerful admixture of intuition and experience.}},

All participants completed a variety of spelling and linguistic tasks to determine overall spelling age, patterns of spelling errors, and abilities across phonemic, orthographic, and morphological awareness. Performance of the spelling-age matched pairs was similar across most of the phonemic, orthographic, and morphological awareness tasks. Analysis of the participants' spelling errors, however, revealed different patterns of spelling errors for three of the spelling-age matched pairs. Within these three pairs, the participants with complex communication needs and physical impairments made most of their spelling errors due to phonemic awareness difficulties, while most of the errors on the part of the participants without disabilities were due to orthographic difficulties. The results of this study lend support to the findings of previous investigations that reported difficulties among individuals with complex communication needs and physical impairments evidence when applying phonemic knowledge to literacy tasks.}},

Current performance was compared to the participants' skills when they were preschoolers and participated in another study of interaction skills (Light, 1985; Light, Collier, \& Parnes, 1985a,b,c). Results indicated that the turn distribution between partners was more equitable than it had been when the participants were preschoolers; five of the participants approached reciprocity in turn taking during at least two of the interactions observed. During interactions with their caregivers, the participants fulfilled most of their obligatory turns and more than half of their non-obligatory turns. The communicative functions used most frequently by the participants were confirmations/denials and provisions of information. Three of the participants demonstrated the ability to use complete and complex syntax and committed few errors in grammar, while the other four participants demonstrated many syntactic errors.

The descriptive analysis showed that a variety of antecedent, both adult and child directed, and consequent intervention components, typically used in combination, were effective in improving communication. Most research contexts were rated as less natural. Parents, teachers, and siblings or peers were infrequently involved in intervention. When problem behavior and communication were targeted, functional communication training (FCT) was the method of choice. Treatment integrity was infrequently measured. When measured, generalization and maintenance of treatment effects were good but were reported less than half of the time. Implications for}},

METHOD: A multidisciplinary team of aphasiologists, augmentative and alternative communication specialists, speech and language therapists and technicians developed a portable, modular system, PCAD (portable communication assistant for people with dysphasia), running on a commercially available handheld computer. The system was tested in a multiple case study. Aphasia therapy services In the UK, Portugal and The Netherlands referred 28 people with aphasia, who were considered eligible for a computerised communication aid. Participants were trained following a protocol and used the device in self-chosen real life settings. RESULTS: Six of the 28 selected aphasic patients decided not to test the device; 22 participated in the training. All 22 learned to operate the aid, 17 used it functionally, in everyday life. Five people did not use the aid outside the therapy room, although they were able to operate the aid and to use it in role play. These unsuccessful clients were younger, and tended to have a shorter duration of the aphasia. CONCLUSIONS: Carefully selected aphasic patients may benefit from a computerised communication aid, using it functionally in everyday communicative settings.}},

@article{Sanger2007Optimizing,
    abstract = {{For children who depend on devices to communicate, the rate of communication is a primary determinant of success. For children with motor impairments, the rate of communication may be limited by inability to contact buttons or cells rapidly or accurately. It is, therefore, essential to know how to adjust the device interface in order to maximize each child's rate of communication. The optimal rate of communication is determined by the channel capacity, which is the maximum value of the information rate for all possible keyboard button or cell layouts for the communication device. We construct a mathematical model for the information rate based on the relationship between movement time and the number of buttons per screen, the size of the buttons, and the length of a sequence of buttons that must be pressed to communicate each word in the vocabulary. We measure the parameters of the model using a custom-programmed touchscreen interface in 10 children with disorders of arm movement due to cerebral palsy who use a DynaVox communication device. We measure the same parameters in 20 healthy control subjects. We show that the model approximates the measured information rate and that the information rate is lower in children with motor impairments compared with control subjects. The theory predicts that for each child there is a combination of button size and number that maximizes the predicted information rate and thereby achieves communication at the optimal channel capacity. Programming communication devices with each child's predicted optimal parameters improved the communication rate in five of the ten children, compared with programming by professionals. Therefore, measurement of information rate may provide an assessment of the effect of motor disorders on success in assisted communication. Optimization of the information rate may be useful for programming assisted communication devices.}},

The upper visual field (UVF) is specialized to support perceptual tasks in the distance, while the lower visual field (LVF) is specialized to support visually-guided motor tasks, such as pointing. We present a user study comparing mouse- and touchscreen-based pointing for items presented in the UVF and LVF on an interactive display. Consistent with the neuroscience literature, we found that mouse and touchscreen pointing were faster and more accurate for items presented in the LVF when compared to pointing at identical targets presented in the UVF. Further analysis found previously unreported performance differences between the visual fields for touchscreen pointing that were not observed for mouse pointing. This indicates that a placement of interactive items favorable to the LVF yields superior user performance, especially for systems dependent on direct touch interactions.}},

It has been questioned, however, whether such savings translate into an enhanced communication rate due to the additional overhead (e.g., shifting of focus and repeated scanning of a prediction list) required in using such a system. Our hypothesis is that word prediction has high potential for enhancing AAC communication rate, but the amount is dependent in a complex way on the accuracy of the predictions. Due to significant user interface variations in AAC systems and the potential bias of prior word prediction experience on existing devices, this hypothesis is difficult to verify. We present a study of two different word prediction methods compared against letter-by-letter entry at simulated AAC communication rates. We find that word prediction systems can in fact speed communication rate (an advanced system gave a 58.6\% improvement), and that a more accurate word prediction system can raise communication rate higher than is explained by the additional accuracy of the system alone due to better utilization (93.6\\ utilization for advanced vs. 78.2\% for basic).}},

This study examined the reliability of new SGDs and found that mean time to first failure was 42.7 (SD = 41.2) weeks and at least 40\% required repairs within the first year of use. The components that most frequently broke down were touch screens, wiring, main boards, batteries, memory cards, and AC adaptors. The costs of repairing SGDs were analyzed. The clinical implications of device breakdown are identified for key stakeholders, including clients, families, service providers, funding agencies, and manufacturers.}},

However, to be useful and authentic, a systematic and principled approach to collecting, analyzing, and reporting case data must be observed. This paper proposes a basic case study format for documenting augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) intervention to ensure reliable and valid measurement of performance and outcomes for evidence-based practice. An example case study of an adult with cerebral palsy who relies on AAC is presented to show how the principles of evidence-based practice (EBP) and performance measurement were applied to the AAC assessment process. AAC service delivery requires performance and outcomes measurement to lead to effective communication and improved quality of life. Reliable and validated methods of reporting data allow for consistency and the comparison of performance and outcome measures so decisions are not based on impressions of effectiveness, but actual results.}},

Results indicate that many preservice programs offer minimal AAC training, faculty members have minimal expertise in AAC, and the effectiveness of preservice programs in equipping professionals for entry-level AAC practice is unclear. Speech-language pathologists, special education teachers, and occupational therapists may thus be at risk of graduating with minimal to no exposure to AAC, with little knowledge or skill in AAC service provision, and may be unprepared for entry-level practice.

    abstract = {{Background  This paper describes the impact of a family-centred intervention that used video to enhance communication in a young girl with cerebral palsy. This single case study describes how the video-based intervention worked in the context of multimodal communication, which included high-tech augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) device use. This paper includes the family's perspective of the video intervention and they describe the impact of it on their family. Methods  This single case study was based on the premise that the video interaction guidance intervention would increase attentiveness between participants during communication. It tests a hypothesis that eye gaze is a fundamental prerequisite for all communicative initiatives, regardless of modality in the child. Multimodality is described as the range of communicative behaviours used by the child and these are coded as AAC communication, vocalizations (intelligible and unintelligible), sign communication, nodding and pointing. Change was analysed over time with multiple testing both pre and post intervention. Data were analysed within INTERACT, a computer software to analyse behaviourally observed data. Behaviours were analysed for frequency and duration, contingency and co-occurrence. Results  Results indicated increased duration of mother's and girl's eye gaze, increased frequency and duration in AAC communication by the girl and significant change in frequency [χ2 (5, n = 1) = 13.25, P < 0.05] and duration [χ2 (5, n = 1) = 12.57, P < 0.05] of the girl's multimodal communicative behaviours. Contingency and co-occurrence analysis indicated that mother's eye gaze followed by AAC communication was the most prominent change between the pre- and post-intervention assessments. Conclusions  There was a trend for increased eye gaze in both mum and girl and AAC communication in the girl following the video intervention. The family's perspective concurs with the results.}},

@article{Pennington1996Speech,
    abstract = {{Background The production of speech, language and gesture for communication is often affected by cerebral palsy. Communication difficulties associated with cerebral palsy can be multifactorial, arising from motor, intellectual and sensory impairments. Children with this diagnosis can experience mild to severe difficulties in expressing themselves. They are often referred to speech and language therapy (SLT) services to maximise their communication skills and help them to take as independent a role as possible in interaction activities. Therapy can include introducing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems, such as symbol charts or communication aids with synthetic speech, as well as treating children's natural forms of communication. Various strategies have been used to treat the communication disorders associated with cerebral palsy, but evidence of their effectiveness is limited. Objectives Objectives To determine the effectiveness of SLT that focuses on the child or their familiar communication partners, as measured by change in interaction patterns. To determine if individual types of SLT intervention are more effective than others in changing interaction patterns. Search methods Search methods Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LLBA, ERIC, WEB of SCIENCE, Scopus, NRR, BEI, SIGLE (to January 2011). A previous version of this review included studies up to the end of 2002. References from identified studies were examined and relevant journals and conference reports were handsearched. Selection criteria Selection criteria Any experimental study containing an element of a control was included in this review. This includes non-randomised group studies and single case experimental designs in which two interventions were compared or two communication processes were examined. Data collection and analysis Data collection and analysis All authors searched for and selected studies for inclusion. L Pennington (LP) assessed all papers for inclusion, J Goldbart (JG) and J Marshall (JM) independently assessed separate random samples, each comprising 25\% of all identified studies. Two review authors independently abstracted data from each selected study. Disagreements were settled by discussion between the three review authors. Main results Main results Sixteen studies were included in the review. Nine studies evaluated treatment given directly to children, seven investigated the effects of training for communication partners. Participants in the studies varied widely in age, type and severity of cerebral palsy, cognitive and linguistic skills. Studies focusing directly on children suggest that this model of therapy delivery has been associated with increases in treated speech and communication skills by individual children. However, methodological flaws and small sample sizes prevent firm conclusions being made about the effectiveness of the therapy. In addition, maintenance of these skills was not investigated thoroughly. The studies targeting communication partners used small exploratory group designs which often contained insufficient detail to allow replication, although more recent studies have improved in this area. Overall, the studies of indirect intervention have very low power and cannot provide evidence of effectiveness of this type of treatment. Authors' conclusions Authors' conclusions Firm evidence of the positive effects of SLT for children with cerebral palsy has not been demonstrated by this review. However, positive trends in communication change were shown. No change in practice is recommended from this updated review. Further research is needed to describe this client group, and its possible clinical subgroups, and the methods of treatment currently used in SLT. Research is also needed to investigate the effectiveness of new and established interventions and their acceptability to families. Rigour in research practice needs to be extended to enable firm associations between therapy and the communication change to be made. There are now sufficient data to develop randomised controlled studies of dysarthria interventions and group parent training programmes. Such research is urgently needed to ensure clinically effective provision for this group of children, who are at severe risk of social and educational exclusion. 背景 以會話和語言治療改善兒童腦性麻痺患者的溝通技巧腦性\'{e}º»痺患者的會話、語言和手勢的溝通能力常受病情影響。腦{\ae}{\S}麻痺患者的溝通困難也被諸多因素影響，例如運動、智能\r{a}/或感覺的障礙。兒童患者要表達自己的時候常常遭遇困難。他們常常被轉診接受會話和語言治療(speech and language therapy，SLT)，以期他們儘可能發揮溝通技巧，並且幫助他\r{a}獨立完成與其他人的交流互動。包括採用加強和替代性溝\'{e}系統(augmentative and alternative communication，AAC)，例如用符號圖表或語音合成器，以幫助\r{a}童用最自然的方式來溝通。已經有許多的治療策略被使用{\ae}¼腦性麻痺患者的溝通障礙，但其效力的證據仍相當有限。 目標 目標 利用孩童及其溝通夥伴之間互動方式的改變，來評估SLT的{\ae}果。 搜尋策略 搜尋策略 我們搜查了至2002年12月為止的MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PSYCH INFO, LLBA, ERIC, WEB of SCIENCE, NRR, BEI，SIGLE。所找出的研究報告中的參考文獻也都進行審查\"{i}¼相關期刊和會議報告則進行了手工搜查。 選擇標準 選擇標準 任何含有對照組的實驗研究都被納入本回顧分析。包括非\'{e}¨機分組研究(nonrandomised group studies)及單一案例實驗設計(single case experimental designs)，其中比較了兩種介入治療的方式，或檢驗了兩種{\ae}º通方式。 資料收集與分析 資料收集與分析 L Pennington搜索和選擇要納入的研究。J Goldbart和J Marshall 獨立評估個別的隨機樣本，各包含所有找出的研究中的25\"{i}¼。兩名審查委員從選定的研究中獨立擷取數據。如有意見\c{c}¸左，則經三位審查委員討論決定。 主要結論 主要結論 1項研究被納入本回顧分析中。7項研究是評估對兒童的直{\ae}¥治療效果，4項研究探討了對溝通夥伴的訓練效果。這些研\c{c}{\copyright}{\P}對象不論在年齡、腦性麻痺的種類和嚴重程度、認知和語\`{e}¨技巧的差異程度都很大。直接針對兒童的治療效果的研究\'{e}!`¯示，這種治療模式提供了孩童溝通技巧的改善。但是，因\c{c}º研究方法上有缺陷，所以無法得到這些治療有效性的確定\c{c}µ論。此外，這些研究並沒有徹底調查這些技能是不是能夠\c{c}{\P}­持。至於針對溝通夥伴的研究，只包含了一些小型的研究\`{e}¨畫，沒有提供足夠的細節可供重複這些研究結果，證據力\"{a}¸足，無法顯示這類型治療的有效性。 作者結論 作者結論 本次的回顧分析顯示，腦性麻痺兒童SLT治療的正面療效仍\c{c}¼º少確鑿的證據。不過，在對於溝通的改變仍有一些正向的\r{a}¹«助。本回顧分析並不建議需要改變目前的治療方式。對於\'{e}一類的病人，或是臨床上分類更細的病患族群，以及目前{\ae}使用的SLT的治療方式，都還需要更進一步的研究。對於新\c{c}、或是現有的治療方式，其對病患家庭的接受度，都還需\`{e}¦進一步評估其有效性。另外進行研究的方式也需要更加嚴\`{e}¬¹，以得到更確切的治療效果。 翻譯人 翻譯人 本摘要由新光醫院鍾禎智翻譯。此翻譯計畫由臺灣國家衛\c{c}研究院(National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan)統籌。 總結 總結 會話和語言治療可能可以改善腦性麻痺兒童的溝通技巧，\"{a}¸過目前對這一部分還需要更多的研究。腦性麻痺(CP)是因出生前、出生時或出生後不久的腦部傷害引起的運動障礙。CP\c{c}人因會話及比手畫腳能力受損，常常會有溝通困難。會話\r{a}語言治療的目的就是幫助病人儘可能發揮他們的溝通技巧\~{a}包括如何增進他們自然的溝通方式、使用輔具，如符號圖\`{e}!`¨或語音合成器、訓練溝通夥伴等。本回顧分析發現，一些\r{a}¾®薄的證據顯示語言治療可能可以幫助CP的小孩，但還需要{\ae}´進一步的研究。}},

    abstract = {{Purpose: In this paper the perceptions of three mentors and three mentees who took part in a speech generating device (SGD) mentoring programme are presented. The aims of the study were to investigate the participants? views on taking part in the mentoring programme and their satisfaction with the outcomes. Method: Information was gathered through semi-structured interviews with the six mentoring programme participants. Interview data were analysed for content themes. Results: Thematic analysis revealed six themes. Of these themes, five were identified in both the mentor and mentee?s data. These themes were: satisfaction with the SGD mentoring programme, mentee improvement in SGD use, the importance of a role model of SGD use, the SGD mentoring relationship as a helping relationship, and SGD mentoring contributes to mentor self-esteem. The remaining theme, mentors who use an SGD learn from the mentoring experience, was generated from the mentor?s data only. Conclusions: The results of this study provide initial evidence in support of mentoring among people who use an SGD. A total of five of the six participants perceived that people learning an SGD can benefit from SGD mentoring by experienced users of SGDs and agreed on a need for such mentoring programmes to improve SGD use. Implications for Rehabilitation A mentoring programme involving experienced and new users of speech generating devices (SGDs) has the potential to improve learners? SGD use. The results of this study provide preliminary evidence in support of mentoring from the perspective of people who took part in an SGD mentoring programme. Five of the six participants perceived that learners can benefit and agreed on a need for such programmes to improve SGD use. Participation in mentoring can contribute to the personal growth of adult mentors and enable them to make a positive contribution to the AAC community.}},

To clarify the AAC Acceptance Model, a case study is provided of an individual with acquired aphasia and apraxia of speech who seemed initially to be an ideal candidate for optimal use of AAC. A trial period conducted prior to acquisition of an AAC system included analysis of the client's communication behaviors using an AAC loaner device in conversation with unfamiliar partners in the clinical setting. After a device was acquired, the individual was reluctant to use it in public places with unfamiliar partners. Clinicians employed specific treatment techniques to promote AAC acceptance. Intervention focused on increasing the user's communicative effectiveness and comfort level in community-based interactions. This case study highlights the importance of all three branches of the AAC Acceptance Model (milieu, person, and technology) in the clinical decision- making process. In addition, the case study illustrates the need for appropriate clinical outcome measures for adults with aphasia.}},

The second question relates to the theoretical constructs underlying this process. An example of applying a model of normal language acquisition in conjunction with Vygotsky's construct of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) to the longitudinal study of language acquisition in a child is provided. The final question pertains to the conditions that may best facilitate the language acquisition process. One particular natural context, that of interactive storybook reading, is examined as a means of promoting the development of early literacy and related language skills.

    abstract = {{The present study applies the theory of learned helplessness to communicative interaction among severely disabled children using nonelectronic pictographic boards. Data were collected through systematic observation of child?parent and child?teacher pairs in natural environments. A program for teaching the family interaction skills was introduced and interactive patterns in the family before and after the introduction of the program were compared. Interactive patterns within the family and at school were also compared. Our results show that the interaction between children using communication boards and natural speaking adults (both parents and teacher) tended to be dominated by the latter, who occupy more of the conversational space and initiate topics much more frequently. Before the introduction of the program, parent and child responsiveness to each other was low. Increases in parent responsiveness after the introduction of the training program seemed to result in increases in the frequency of responses by the four disabled children in the study. The percentage of parents' open questions also increased after training, which in turn seemed to result in increases in children's board-conveyed utterances. Positive and negative effects of the family program are highlighted. As well, the need for new approaches to enhance the interactive skills of children using communication boards is discussed.}},

    abstract = {{Described is a case study in which a 6-year-old, functionally nonspeaking girl with severe spastic-athetoid cerebral palsy underwent 7 months of augmentative communication intervention involving parallel training in eye-gaze communication and switch-access programming. Typical of many severely physically impaired augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) clients, the child's lack of a reliable means of communication at the outset of intervention precluded insight into her true developmental status. Assessment was further confounded by the fact that English was the child's second language. AAC intervention was therefore initiated on the basis of minimal diagnostic input. Despite this fact, all AAC programming was conducted in a contexually relevant, highly interactive format using aided language stimulation techniques to foster frequent interactive symbolic use. Results of intervention were quite dramatic with both picture symbol communication and functional speech emerging. With the attainment of a reliable means of communication, professionals were eventually able to evaluate the child's true developmental status. A severely physically impaired child, initially believed to be mentally retarded, was ultimately determined to be of normal intelligence.}},

Method: In Study I, two participants triggered an automatic scanning keyboard and selected/wrote letters via a small sliding movement of their hand(s) activating a touch/pressure panel (microswitch). In Study II, a third participant used the sliding movement and panel and a vocalization response with a voice-detecting microswitch. The sliding movement allowed her to light up the keyboard and select the letters and the vocalization to perform the scanning. Results: Participants showed a better performance (shorter writing time) or an equally effective but less tiring performance with the new microswitch technology and response(s). They also preferred using this technology, and social validation ratings favoured such technology over previous solutions.

    abstract = {{Abstract Purpose: To study the experiences of adults who use augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) systems and methods when interacting with medical providers, specifically primary care providers. Method: Individual face-to-face interviews were conducted with 12 participants, four of whom also participated in an online focus group. Diagnoses of the participants included cerebral palsy, undifferentiated developmental disability, head and neck cancer, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and primary lateral sclerosis. Transcripts from the interviews and the focus group were analyzed to create a list of codes. From these codes themes that captured particular concepts discussed were identified. Results: Participants described multiple frustrations in communicating with medical care providers. Themes that arose included: planning and preparing for the appointment, time barriers, inappropriate assumptions, relationship building and establishing rapport, medical decision making and implementing the plan. All but one participant reported bringing a caregiver with them to their appointments and this person, whether a family member, friend or paid aide, had a substantial role throughout the appointment. Conclusions: The participants? stories highlight important barriers they experience when communicating with medical providers. These barriers bring attention to the need for education for physicians, caregivers and patients with communication disabilities, along with increased research to improve patient--provider communication. Implications for Rehabilitation Patients with communication disabilities face multiple barriers to communicating with medical care providers. Patients, caregivers, and medical care providers all play a role in effective and ineffective communication during appointments. Education for medical care providers, caregivers, and patients with communication disabilities, along with increased research is needed to improve patient-provider communication.}},

    abstract = {{Aided Language Stimulation (ALS) is a communication partner strategy with potential to be used by parents with children with communication disabilities across a range of daily activities. Communication disability can result in low educational achievement, social isolation and reduced ability to live independently. Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) is used to help people understand and express language, build relationships and access education. Approximately 0.03 -1.4\\ of children use AAC. Abandonment rates are estimated at 30\%. Poorly designed AAC and a lack of communication partner training could be contributing factors to abandonment. Research indicates ALS is potentially effective in schools and clinics. Home intervention has not been investigated. Qualitative studies have shown some parents want more involvement in their children's AAC services and want AAC services at home. Aims: This study aims to investigate whether ALS could be an effective home intervention for AAC-users aged 11-16 by investigating the impact on the communicative competence of parents. Parents' experiences of home intervention would also be investigated. Methods: A mixed methods design was proposed that measured before and after intervention responses to a self-rated questionnaire. Qualitative information would then be gained through focus group interviews with participants. Participants in the study were recruited from a London Special School. Four families were sought. Results: One parent-child pair participated in the study. Participants were withdrawn before completing intervention due to family bereavement. Subjective data indicated the parent was able to implement ALS successfully, bilingually and involve other members of the family. Information from the family's perspective was unavailable. Objective measures of change were also unavailable. Barriers participation in therapy are discussed. The effects of ALS on parents' communicative competence are undetermined. The successful implementation of ALS during the intervention period is encouraging. ALS could be a viable option to supporting children with AAC at home.

To type with the eyes, gaze typing, is considerably slower than speaking or typing with hands. The purpose of this master thesis is to explore the possibilities of faster gaze typing and to develop a new interface with which it is possible to type faster than with Tobii's standard interface. First we developed a theoretical model with the purpose of evaluating gaze typing interfaces with a special focus on maximum typing speed. While it could serve as a useful set of tools, the existing uncertainties in user properties are limiting the effectiveness of the model. Next we conducted an investigation of word prediction engines that showed that SwiftKey was the most efficient engine in a group of ten. SwiftKey saved in average 29\% entry load in a more extensive evaluation performed. Finally we created a new gaze typing interface prototype, named GazeSwitcher. With practical tests we compared it with Tobii's standard interface (Gaze Selection keyboard) and with a new prototype from Tobii, the Circular keyboard. GazeSwitcher was significant faster than the Circular keyboard in all measurements and also faster than the Gaze Selection keyboard for top-speed results, but not in the overall average. A list of improvement suggestions for these three interfaces is included in the thesis.}},

Included is an examination of what is currently known about decision-making in AAC, as well as a brief history of EBP and its application in other fields. A definition of EBP in AAC is proposed and a schematic of the EBP process is described, including proposed design hierarchies of evidence. This process is then illustrated with a case example. Finally, key factors for the adoption of EBP in AAC are discussed.}},

There is a substantial body of research that demonstrates convincingly that children with CCN derive substantial benefits from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) in their development of communication, language and literacy skills, with no risk to their speech development. Future research must address two significant challenges in order to maximize outcomes for children with CCN: (1) investigating how to improve the design of AAC apps/technologies so as to better meet the breadth of communication needs for the diverse population of children with CCN; and (2) ensuring the effective translation of these evidence-based AAC interventions to the everyday lives of children with CCN so that the possible becomes the probable. This article considers each of these challenges in turn, summarizing the state of the science as well as directions for future research and development. }},

    abstract = {{Abstract Purpose: Navigating high-technology augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices with dynamic displays can be challenging for people with aphasia. The purpose of this study was to determine which of two AAC interfaces two people with aphasia could use most efficiently and accurately. Method: The researchers used a BCB?C? alternating treatment design to provide device-use instruction to two people with severe aphasia regarding two personalised AAC interfaces that had different navigation layouts but identical content. One interface had static buttons for homepage and go-back features, and the other interface had static buttons in a navigation ring layout. Throughout treatment, the researchers monitored participants? mastery patterns regarding navigation efficiency and accuracy when locating target messages. Results: Participants? accuracy and efficiency improved with both interfaces given intervention; however, the navigation ring layout appeared more transparent and better facilitated navigation than the homepage layout. Conclusions: People with aphasia can learn to navigate computerised devices; however, interface layout can substantially affect the efficiency and accuracy with which they locate messages. Implications for Rehabilitation Given intervention incorporating errorless learning principles, people with chronic aphasia can learn to navigate across multiple device levels to locate target sentences. Both navigation ring and homepage interfaces may be used by people with aphasia. Some people with aphasia may be more consistent and efficient in finding target sentences using the navigation ring interface than the homepage interface. Additionally, the navigation ring interface may be more transparent and easier for people with aphasia to master ? that is, they may require fewer intervention sessions to learn to navigate the navigation ring interface. Generalisation of learning may result from use of the navigation ring interface. Specifically, people with aphasia may improve navigation with the homepage interface as a result of instruction on the navigation interface, but not vice versa.}},

@article{Erickson2007Literacy,
    abstract = {
                Research supporting specific instructional approaches for young children with visual impairments and blindness is limited. There is, however, a growing body of evidence to support the belief that the critical components of emergent and early conventional literacy for children with visual impairments do not differ markedly from those of their sighted peers. Specifically, infants and toddlers with visual impairments and blindness require interactions that support their oral language development, awareness of print or braille, and opportunities to explore writing. Although these very young children are often delayed in developing emergent literacy understandings, the path of their development is consistent with emergent literacy development of sighted children. The research regarding older children with visual impairments and blindness suggests that they too benefit from instruction that emphasizes the critical elements of early literacy instruction for all children. Research also suggests that specific strategies, such as repeated readings, direct instruction in phonics, and big word decoding that emphasizes morphemes, can benefit school-aged children with visual impairments and blindness. Further research is needed if we are to understand fully the most effective approaches to emergent and early literacy instruction for children with visual impairments and blindness, but there is a solid base from which we can begin.

    abstract = {
                The understanding of written or printed text or discourse - depicted either in orthographical, graphic-visual or tactile symbols - calls upon both bottom-up word recognition processes and top-down comprehension processes. Different architectures have been proposed to account for literacy processes. Research has shown that the first steps in perceiving, processing and deriving conceptual meaning from words, graphic symbols, manual signs, and co-speech gestures or tactile manual signing and tangible symbols can be seen as identical and collectively (sub)activated. Results from recent brain research and neurolinguistics have revealed new insights in the reading process of typical and atypical readers and may provide verifiable evidence for improved literacy assessment and the validation of early intervention programs for AAC users.

The performance of a group of 32 AAC users, aged 7.5 to 17.5, was compared to that of a group of reading-level-matched younger children who had normal speech and no physical disabilities. Phonological recoding was assessed using a pseudoword speech-to-print matching task, a pseudoword spelling task, and two adapted pseudoword reading tasks. Multiple tasks, including those related to phoneme recognition, deletion, and substitution, were also used to assess phoneme awareness. A pseudoword alliteration task to assess partial accuracy in pseudoword reading was found to be appropriate for AAC users. In addition, the relationships between the participants' scores on the phonological recoding and phoneme awareness tasks and two measures of word reading were found to be at least as strong as those for the comparison group. Furthermore, in the AAC user group, scores on the pseudoword speech-to-print matching task were strongly related to word reading. On the basis of these results, we suggest that a detailed assessment of phonological processing would be useful for both understanding the literacy learning needs of students who use AAC and for designing interventions in this regard.},
